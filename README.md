# FaceMeshProject
This Project is a face mesh project and extensively uses opencv-python and mediapipe. This is the perfect way to learn image processing. NO GPU required! Just the CPU would work. Also can track all 468 points on your face. The IDs of each point can be inferred from the mediapipe's page. So what are you waiting for> Code your masks now! Happy Coding!!
<li>The <b>FaceMeshBasics</b> covers the basic minimum code to achieve our goals
<li>The <b>FaceMeshModule</b? contains the code in an object oriented format so that it can be accessed later as a module in any game/application
